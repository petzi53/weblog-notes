Last week – just before Christmas – I received two badges: [DORA](https://sfdora.org/) (San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment) sent me a newsletter about their advances for fostering Open Science in 2019. On this occasion, DORA also issued badges for individuals and organizations that have signed the declaration.

The other badge came from [Wakelet](https://learn.wakelet.com/). As I had applied to be part of the Wakelet community, they welcomed me with an email with some tips and hints and issued the Community Badge to me.

So just in time for Christmas Eve, I am honored with these two gratifications. I thought about a little thank-you gift. What I came up with was a Wakelet collection of DORA's newsletter, which essentially is a commented list link. I turned these links into a 'Wake' with some added value: Besides the DORA list, there is additional information in every linked section generated automatically by Wakelet. Additionally, the link list is now more visually appealing. So I killed two birds with one stone: A Wakelet about DORA's advances of the year 2019! Enjoy!
