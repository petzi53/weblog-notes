<p>Last week – just before Christmas – I received two badges: <a href="https://sfdora.org/">DORA</a> (San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment) sent me a newsletter about their advances for fostering Open Science in 2019. On this occasion, DORA also issued badges for individuals and organizations that have signed the declaration.</p>
<p>The other badge came from <a href="https://learn.wakelet.com/">Wakelet</a>. As I had applied to be part of the Wakelet community, they welcomed me with an email with some tips and hints and issued the Community Badge to me.</p>

<p>So just in time for Christmas Eve, I am honored with these two gratifications. I thought about a little thank-you gift. What I came up with was a Wakelet collection of DORA’s newsletter, which essentially is a commented list link. I turned these links into a ‘Wake’ with some added value: Besides the DORA list, there is additional information in every linked section generated automatically by Wakelet. Additionally, the link list is now more visually appealing. So I killed two birds with one stone: A Wakelet about DORA’s advances of the year 2019! Enjoy!
